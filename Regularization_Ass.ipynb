    "# Regularization in the context of deep learning refers to techniques used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Regularization helps to improve the generalization ability of a model by discouraging it from fitting too closely to the noise or fluctuations in the training data. It introduces additional information to the model or constraints to reduce its complexity.\n",

    "# Benefits of Early Stopping:\n",
